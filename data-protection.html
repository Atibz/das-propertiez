In some cases, this data is processed to comply with legal obligations imposed by governmental authorities, regulators or law enforcement agencies.</p>
    <p>We recognise that maintaining the trust and confidence of those we interact with is vital to our success. Our handling of personal data is underpinned by a robust governance structure, including the implementation of a Personal Information Management System (PIMS), which ensures consistent adherence to legal standards and industry best practices.</p>

    <h2>Scope and Applicability</h2>

<h1>MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY</h1>
<p>DAS Properties and Investment Limited is committed to maintaining robust systems and controls to prevent the facilitation of money laundering and terrorist financing. This policy outlines the company’s responsibilities under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Terrorism Act 2000, and the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), where applicable.</p>
<p>DAS Properties conducts due diligence checks on all parties involved in a transaction, including vendors, landlords, purchasers and tenants. This includes verifying:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identity and proof of address</li>
  <li>The existence of any beneficial owners (individuals who ultimately own or control a customer)</li>
  <li>Where appropriate, the source of funds, source of wealth and/or destination of funds</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure to provide this information will prevent us from proceeding with property marketing, concluding a sale or finalising a tenancy.</p>

<h4>Risk Awareness & Assessment</h4>
<p>The real estate sector is considered high-risk for money laundering due to the high-value nature of transactions and potential for anonymity.</p>
<p>DAS Properties adopts a risk-based approach to AML/CTF. We assess risk factors including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer type and geography</li>
  <li>Customer type and geography</li>
  <li>Whether there is face-to-face interaction</li>
  <li>Use of third parties or intermediaries</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach allows us to apply enhanced due diligence where necessary and maintain vigilance over suspicious behaviours.</p>

<h4>Managing Risk & Internal Controls</h4>
<p>We maintain internal policies and procedures to detect and deter financial crime. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)</li>
  <li>Ongoing AML training for all relevant staff</li>
  <li>Internal reporting mechanisms for suspicious activity</li>
  <li>Procedures for escalating reports to the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK, or relevant authorities where applicable</li>
</ul>
<p>Our MLRO is responsible for evaluating and escalating all suspicious activity reports (SARs) and ensuring compliance with legal obligations.</p>
<h4>Identification & Verification Process</h4>
<p>As part of our due diligence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All customers must undergo electronic identity verification</li>
  <li>The AML verification fee is £30 per person (inclusive of VAT) and is non-refundable</li>
  <li>Where electronic verification is not possible, certified identity documents must be provided from a list of acceptable alternatives</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect identification details for other stakeholders in a transaction, such as individuals gifting deposit funds.</p>
<p>Note: Our identity verification process does not affect your credit score or credit history.</p>
<h4>Non-Individual Clients</h4>
<p>Where the customer is an entity (e.g., company, charity, trust), we are required to verify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Company registration details and registered address</li>
  <li>Authority of the individual(s) acting on behalf of the organisation</li>
  <li>Identity of beneficial owners or persons with significant control</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures transparency and compliance with both AML legislation and corporate governance standards.</p>
<h4>Reporting Suspicious Activity</h4>
<p>All staff have a duty to report suspicious activity internally to the MLRO. Suspicious activity may include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>For new customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unwillingness to provide ID</li>
  <li>Use of intermediaries with no clear rationale</li>
  <li>Lack of a legitimate reason for property transactions</li>
</ul>

<h4>For existing customers:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Third-party payments with no clear link to the client</li>
  <li>Unusual requests to transfer funds to unrelated parties</li>
  <li>Transactions far below market value</li>
  <li>Refusal to disclose the source of large cash payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Confidentiality: All reports and associated information are treated as confidential and shared strictly on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<h4>Record Keeping</h4>
<p>In line with regulatory obligations, we retain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identity verification records for 5 years from the end of the customer relationship or transaction</li>
  <li>Transaction and communication records for 5 years from completion</li>
</ul>
<p>This supports regulatory compliance and assists in any future investigations.</p>

<h4>Staff Training</h4>
<p>DAS Properties provides ongoing training to all employees on AML/CTF obligations. Staff are required to understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to identify and report suspicious activity</li>
  <li>Procedures for customer identification</li>
  <li>Their responsibilities under the law</li>
</ul>
<p>Training records are maintained to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<h4>Policy Governance</h4>
<p>This policy is reviewed annually or in response to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes in AML/CTF legislation</li>
  <li>Regulatory guidance</li>
  <li>Organisational or operational developments</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy is approved by senior management and forms part of DAS Properties' wider compliance framework, including data protection and business ethics.</p>
